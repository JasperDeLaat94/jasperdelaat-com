> Term1nal is one of the first full-blown action puzzler games for mobile VR.

**Term1nal** is a 3D action puzzle game for the Samsung Gear VR that I worked on as a **gameplay programmer** for Force Field Entertainment.
It received favourable [reviews](https://www.vrfocus.com/2017/05/review-term1nal/).

## Contributions
Key contributions included:
- Collaborating with designers on puzzle design, then take care of the technical implementation.
- Design and implement a comprehensive trigger/interaction system so designers can easily link together puzzles, switches and doors and other gameplay elements inside a level.
- Measure and resolve performance issues on Gear VR devices (Samsung Galaxy S6, S7, S8, both Exynos and Snapdragon-based) to ensure a constant 60Hz experience and avoid overheating.
- Implementation and collaboration with an [external audio producer](https://sonicpicnic.nl/en/work/term1nal-2/) for all audio.
