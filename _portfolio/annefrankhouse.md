> Immerse yourself in Anne Frank's thoughts as you traverse the faithfully recreated hidden back house.

**Anne Frank House VR** is an educational VR experience for the Samsung Gear VR that I worked on as a **gameplay programmer** for Force Field Entertainment.
The project was commissioned by the Anne Frank Stichting to give visitors a special view into the secret annex as it was during WW2.

The original version I worked on was a 3DoF version for Gear VR. The project was later revised with 6DoF support for Oculus Quest, Go and Rift.

## Contributions included
- Collaborate with art and design on the implementation of a speech bubble system for Anne Frank's diary excerpts.
- Ensure performance on Gear VR is consistent throughout the experience.
- Tackled internationalization challenges, such as Hebrew text going right-to-left in an animated text system.
- Implementation and collaboration with an external audio producer for audio implementation.
