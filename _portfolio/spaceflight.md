> Experience what itâ€™s like to travel to outer space.

**Space Flight** is a location-based VR experience with Rumble support that I worked on as a **support programmer** for Force Field Entertainment.
I worked on the initial version which was implemented in **Unity 5.6** and utilized a 'Buttkicker' (a rumble pack that can be attached to a chair).

The project was later revised in Unreal Engine 4 using the D-Box motion chair for use in select IMAX cinemas around the globe.

## Contributions included
- Collaborate with artists and implement frameworks and tools to help them create the experience.
- Implement specialized rumble hardware (ButtKicker).
- Fix performance and visual bugs.
