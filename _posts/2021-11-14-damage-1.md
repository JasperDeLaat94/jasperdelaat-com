**Damage** is a common concept in games and interactive experiences. Unreal Engine provides a handy little framework for dealing and receiving damage. 

This tutorial aims to give you an introduction to the Damage system in blueprint and C++, including tips and tricks that I have learned from experience.

## Damage in Unreal
To [borrow a phrase from Alex Forsythe](https://youtu.be/JOJP0CvpB8w?t=6): With Unreal, damage comes standard. It's a feature that is part of the **Actor** class, meaning that every actor class that you've created so far already natively supports dealing & receiving damage!

Let's start this tutorial with a quick introduction to the concept of instigator. After that, we'll move the essentials of dealing and receiving damage in both blueprint and C++.

## Instigator
You might already have seen the term "instigator" a few times while working in Unreal, most likely when spawning an actor. Every actor has an `Instigator` property, it is a reference to a **Pawn** and represents the pawn/character responsible for any actions the spawned actor will do. 

The instigator is usually set when you spawn the actor. In blueprints, this is done like this:

![A call to SpawnActor in blueprint with the Instigator parameter](/assets/images/damage-1/spawn-instigator.png)

In C++, you can set the instigator pawn in the `FActorSpawnParameters` struct:
```cpp
void AYourPawn::SpawnProjectile(const TSubclassOf<AActor> ProjectileClass)
{
    // Assert that FP_MuzzleLocation is a valid component.
    check(FP_MuzzleLocation != nullptr);

    // Spawn a projectile at a specified transform, with instigator set to this pawn.
    const FTransform& SpawnTransform = FP_MuzzleLocation->GetComponentTransform();
    FActorSpawnParameters SpawnParams;
    SpawnParams.Instigator = this;
    World->SpawnActor<AActor>(ProjectileClass, SpawnTransform, SpawnParams);
}
```

The concept of instigators is incredibly useful for damage: It allows a damage receiver to act differently depending on who was responsible for dealing the damage. The classroom example for this is *friendly fire*: If you receive damage and the instigator of the damage is someone on your own team, you might decide to ignore the damage if friendly fire is disabled.

## Dealing damage
To inflict damage on an actor with blueprints, simply call the `ApplyDamage` function:

![A call to ApplyDamage in blueprint with the relevant arguments](/assets/images/damage-1/apply-damage.png)

Let's briefly talk about some of the parameters:
- `Damaged Actor`: The actor you're dealing damage *to*.
- `Event Instigator`: The **controller** that is *responsible* for dealing this damage. You can obtain the instigator controller using the `GetInstigatorController` node.
- `Damage Causer`: The actor that *actually dealt* this damage (e.g. a projectile or grenade).
- `Damage Type Class`: An object that can influence damage calculations. This deserves a tutorial on it's own so we will just keep it empty for now.

In addition to `ApplyDamage`, there are also separate, specialized functions for dealing point and radial damage. Point damage is for damage at a particular point, coming from a particular direction (like being hit with a bullet). Radial damage is for damage in a wider area, possibily affecting multiple actors (like a grenade blast). I will write a separate tutorial about these damage variants in the future.

The C++ equivalent for dealing damage is `AActor::TakeDamage`. While the blueprint equivalent has different functions for each damage variant (i.e. point, radius, etc.), the `TakeDamage` function combines all of these into one with a `FDamageEvent` struct to differentiate between the variants.

Dealing damage in C++ is pretty simple though, here is the equivalent for the above blueprint example:
```cpp
void AYourActor::DealDamageTo(class AActor* OtherActor)
{
    // Much like the blueprint example, we're not using DamageType yet.
    OtherActor->TakeDamage(4.2f, FDamageEvent(), GetInstigatorController(), this);
}
```

For dealing point and radial damage, you will need to supply a `FPointDamageEvent` or `FRadialDamageEvent` with the proper arguments, instead of the `FDamageEvent`. For applying radial damage, I recommend using the `UGameplayStatics::ApplyRadialDamage` helper function instead.

## Responding to damage
While any actor can receive damage, by default they will do nothing. Responding to damage in an actor is as simple as overriding the `AnyDamage` function in blueprint. For C++ things are a bit more tricky, we'll get to that after the blueprint stuff.

In addition to the *any* damage function, there are also separate functions for receiving *point* and *radial* damage. Keep in mind that when you receive point or radial damage, `AnyDamage` will still get called! 

The following is an example of responding to damage blueprint, simply override the `AnyDamage` function:

![The AnyDamage node](/assets/images/damage-1/receive-damage.png)

Most of the function arguments here are the same as the values you provided to the `ApplyDamage` function. The only exception is `Damage Type`, which is now an object reference rather than a class reference, more info on this in a future tutorial.

In addition to `AnyDamage`, there is also the `OnTakeAnyDamage` event dispatcher. This event is particularly useful if you have a component that takes care of dealing with damage, rather than the actor itself:

![An example of using the OnTakeAnyDamage event in an actor component](/assets/images/damage-1/receive-damage-event.png)

Unfortunately, the C++ function `ReceiveAnyDamage` in `AActor` was not made virtual by Epic, so it cannot be overridden. The next best way is to override the `TakeDamage` function instead (`InternalTakeRadialDamage` and `InternalTakePointDamage` exist for radial and point damage respectively):

```cpp
float AYourActor::TakeDamage(const float DamageAmount, FDamageEvent const& DamageEvent, AController* EventInstigator, AActor* DamageCauser)
{
    // If you need the DamageType object like in blueprint, this is how you do it:
    UDamageType const* const DamageTypeCDO = DamageEvent.DamageTypeClass ? DamageEvent.DamageTypeClass->GetDefaultObject<UDamageType>() : GetDefault<UDamageType>();

    // Make sure to call Super so blueprint & event dispatchers still fire.
    return Super::TakeDamage(DamageAmount, DamageEvent, EventInstigator, DamageCauser);
}
```

Fortunately, the `OnTakeAnyDamage` delegate can simply be bound to in C++, just like with blueprint:
```cpp
void UYourActorComponent::BeginPlay()
{
    Super::BeginPlay();

    // Subscribe to the owner receiving damage event.
    GetOwner()->OnTakeAnyDamage.AddDynamic(this, &UYourActorComponent::OnTakeRadialDamage);
}

void UYourActorComponent::OnTakeRadialDamage(AActor* DamagedActor, float Damage, const UDamageType* DamageType, AController* InstigatedBy, AActor* DamageCauser)
{
    // Your damage handling code here..
}
```

## Conclusion
This tutorial has covered the basics of damage: It explained the role of instigators, how damage should be dealt and how it should be received, both in blueprint and C++.

**Next tutorial:** Point and radial damage (coming soonâ„¢)
