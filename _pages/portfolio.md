Hey there, my name is Jasper. I'm a game developer, primarily the programming bits and pieces. 

I started out getting my bachelor in [Game Architecture & Design](https://www.buas.nl/en/programmes/creative-media-and-game-technologies) at the [NHTV (now BUas)](https://www.buas.nl/en) in 2016.
Since then, I've built up 5+ years of experience in the games industry as a gameplay programmer. 

Feel free to take a look at a selection of projects I've worked on below.
